Youtube jukebox app
===================

**KingJuke** (short: **KJuke**) is a youtube jukebox application. It allows
you to host a playlist to which people can submit Youtube videos.

Why is it cool ?
================

**Everybody can submit songs** Every person at the party can add a song to
the playlist, knowing that it is going to be played at some point. No
more jack unplugging, DJ stalking, etc...

**Score system**. If you see a nice song in the playlist, you can upvote it
to make it climb to the top. It is also possible to downvote songs you don't
like.

**Music tags**. It is possible to add a few tags to describe it.

**Playlist theme**. You can add a theme to the playlist, so that your guests
are aware of what kind of music you would like to be played tonight.

**Admin mode**. The admin of the playlist has huge power (and
responsibilities): He can delete songs, pause the playlist, skip songs, set
the playlist theme, etc...

Installation
============

Run ``python setup.py install`` to install KingJuke. You will also need the
``vlc-nox`` package.
